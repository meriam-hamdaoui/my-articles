## In this file I'll take you through the project coding step by step after settig up the react app and it' dependecies

1 - First things first let me explain the app purpose:
    As the name indicate, this app will give the user a form to write/add articles to his website
    and to do this he will need a form to fill in the article. An article needs a title and a body(description)

2 - To define an article in this project using typescript template, we need an interface that defines the article object structure
    so I have created a type.d.ts file where all the interfaces, types and props will be define. 

3 - The articles form is defined into AddArticle functionul component: 
    It has a save function as a props, which i defined it as a type props inside the type.d.ts file as well

The second thing is that we want our users to be aware that the form is empty so he can not add an empty article
