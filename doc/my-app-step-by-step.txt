## In this file I'll take you through the project coding step by step after settig up the react app and it' dependecies

1 - First things first let me explain the app purpose:
    As the name indicate, this app will give the user a form to write/add/delete articles to his website
    and to do this he will need a form to fill in the article. An article needs a title and a body(description)

2 - To define an article in this project using typescript template, we need an interface that defines the article object structure
    so I have created a type.d.ts file where all the interfaces, types and props will be define. 

3 - The articles form is defined into AddArticle functional component: 
    It has a save function as a props, which i defined it as a type props inside the type.d.ts file as well

4 - Mapping the article to our page needs an article component format, which is the Article.tsx file.
    All articles have a delete button so the user can delete his article any time.
    It consumes an object as props which we we'll define it inside our type file, this object have 2 propreties:
        i - an article of type article interface
        ii - a function to delete an article

// Till now we were at the easy part of our project, the components we need
// Now, we're gonna move on to the action using redux (action types/creator and the store)

5 - Action Types: we only have 2 actions: add and remove, written into action-types.ts file
    1st one is for adding new article while removing is just deleting an existing article from the list.

6 - Action Creator : 2 functions associeted to the Action Types as it indicates. add and remove articles:
    Each action will have a type, which it's define into type.d.ts file
    The both functions consumes an article as an argument and returns nothing

7 - The reducer file contain the initiale state of type ArticleState (defined into type.d.ts file) and the reducer function to dispatch to the component.
    We will need a dispacth type for this.
    Beside the reducer actions, we will create the store to provide it to the articles app

8 - After all this work, let's create our store and dispatch all the action to our buttons

One last thing is that we want our users to be aware that the form is empty so he can not add an empty article, so I disable the add button
